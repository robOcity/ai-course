    "\n",
    "\"Clearly, it is discrete, static, and single-agent. (The wumpus doesn’t move, fortunately.)  It is sequential, because rewards may come only after many actions are taken. It is partially observable, because some aspects of the state are not directly perceivable: the agent’s location, the wumpus’s state of health, and the availability of an arrow. As for the locations of the pits and the wumpus: we could treat them as unobserved parts of the state that happen to be immutable—in which case, the transition model for the environment is completely known; or we could say that the transition model itself is unknown because the agent doesn’t know which Forward actions are fatal—in which case, discovering the locations of pits and wumpus completes the agent’s knowledge of the transition model.\"  \n",
