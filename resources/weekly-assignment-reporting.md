# Weekly Status for Coding Projects

Find all resources you need to get started in the Week 1 -- Python Project 1 folder.  Complete your weekly coding and describe your experiences by answering the questions in the progress-report.md template.  Credit is given for progress made and systematic problem-solving (see Python Project Rubric for details).  Submit your weekly progress report as a PDF file to the Week 1 -- Python Project 1 folder.

Get help on the assignment by posting your questions to Project 1- Python Warm-Up Discussion topic.  Be brave; others probably have the same question too.  Support others by sharing ideas, techniques, resources, and small code snippets, but no solutions, please.
