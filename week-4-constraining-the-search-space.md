# Week 4 - Constraining the Search Space

1. **Motivation**: Applying constraints to reduce the size of the search space resulting in dramatic improvements in search algorithm performance.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Explain what a _constraint satisfaction problem_ (CSP) is.

    1. Discuss a real world problem that can be described as a CSP.

    1. Illustrate how backtracking can be used to solve a CSP.

    1. Contrast different approaches used to solve CSPs, such as backtracking and local search.

    1. Show how the 8-queens problem can be solved using backtracking.

    1. Relate the complexity of solving a CSP with the graph of its constraints.

1. **Readings**

    1. Read Chapter 6 - Constraint Satisfaction Problems (all sections)

    1. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

1. **Discussion**

    1. Discuss:  Programming assignment. Post questions about the assignment here and please offer assistance to others.

    1. Discuss:  Identify two real world problems that can be described as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP).  If they are relevant to your work, all the better.  _Write at least a paragraph about each describing the problem, how it is modeled and what algorithms are utilized in their solutions by midnight Wednesday_.

1. **Quiz**

    1. Discuss: Explain why it is a good heuristic to choose the variable that is most _constrained_ but the value tat is least _constraining_ in a CSP search.
