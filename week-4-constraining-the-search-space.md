# Week 4 - Constraining the Search Space

1. Motivation: pplying constraints to reduce the size of the search space resulting in dramatic improvements in search algorithm performance.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Explain what a _constraint satisfaction problem_ (CSP) is.

    1. Disucss a real world problem that can be described as a CSP.

    1. Illustrate how backtracking can be used to solve a CSP.

    1. Contrast differenct approaches used to solve CSPs such as backtracking and local search.

    1. Show how the 8-queens problem can be solved using backtracking.

    1. Relate the complexity of solving a CSP with the graph of its constraints.

1. **Readings**
    1. Read Chapter 6 - Constraint Satisfaction Problems (sections)
