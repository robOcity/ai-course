# Week 7 - Machine Learning in AI

1. Motivation: Imagine trying to program a agent to recognize hand-written numbers, or to predict home prices.  Instead of programming it directly, let's use apply algorithms that learn from the experience.  In this chapter, we will consider machine learning from the perspective of artificial intelligence.  This week we focus on decision trees and ways to improve and evaluate model performance.

1. Learning objectives

    1. Explain how computation learning theory eliminates poorly performing models leaving those that are probably approximately correct.

    1. Construct a decision tree by recursively selecting the most important feature.

    1. Compare common approaches to improving the performance of decision trees.

    1. Evaluate model performance and how it can be improved through cross-validation and regularization.

    1. Understand the trade-off between bias, variance and model complexity.

1. Readings
    1. Read Chapter 18 - Learning from Examples (sections 18.1 through 18.4)

    1. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

1. Discussion

    1. Consider the topics we have covered in the course:

        * Finding solution using search
        * Applying search to adversarial environments
        * Solving constraint satisfaction problems
        * Probabilistic reasoning in uncertain situations
        * Learning from examples

        Pick one topic, find out who it is being used today, what problems is being applied and by what industries.  Find job openings that are looking for people skilled in this domain.  Where are the jobs, what skill sets are in demand and additional training do you need.  Please write three paragraphs and cite your sources.  _Please submit your post by Wednesday evening at midnight and comment on two other students work by Sunday evening at midnight._

    1. Suppose we generate a training set from a decision tree and then apply decision-tree learning to that training set. Is it the case that the learning algorithm will eventually return the correct tree as the training-set size goes to infinity? Why or why not? _Please submit your post by Wednesday evening at midnight and comment on two other students work by Sunday evening at midnight._
