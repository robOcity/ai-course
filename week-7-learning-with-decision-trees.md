# Week 7 - Machine Learning in AI

1. Motivation: Imagine trying to program a agent to recognize hand-written numbers, or to predict home prices.  Instead of programming it directly, let's use apply algorithms that learn from the experience.  In this chapter, we will consider machine learning from the perspective of artificial intelligence.  This week we focus on decision trees and ways to improve and evaluate model performance.

1. Learning objectives

    1. Construct a decision tree by recursively selecting the most important feature.

    2. Compare common approaches to improving the performance of decision trees.

    3. Evaluate model performance and how it can be improved through cross-validation and regularization.

    4. Understand the trade-off between bias, variance and model complexity.

2. Readings
    1. Read Chapter 18 - Learning from Examples (sections 18.1 through 18.4)

    2. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

4. Discussion

    1. Discuss:  Programming assignment. Post any questions you have about the assignment here and please offer assistance to others.

    2. Read [Technical challenges in machine ethics](https://robohub.org/technical-challenges-in-machine-ethics/) and illustrate at least two different approaches to addressing ethical concerns in AI. Can an AI be both logical and ethical? What duties and obligations does an AI have?  _Support your position and post your discussion by midnight Wednesday and reply to two other students by midnight Sunday._
