# Week 5 - Where the wumpus lurks

1. Solve problems 7.1 and 7.2 in our text book and submit them to the course assignments folder for this week as a PDF file.  You can solve problem 7.2 by creating an Jupyter notebook based on the `logic.ipynb` in `aima-python` that we used last week.  Or, you can solve it on paper, take a picture of your work and create a document that includes it.

1. One way to do this would be to put your photo in the `aima-python/images` directory.  Create a markdown cell in your notebook and create a link.  For example, if your file is named `my-work-7-2.jpg`  and is located in the `./images` subdirectory of where your ipynb file is located, your link would be `![7.2 solution](./images/my-work-7-2.jpg)`.
