# Week 7 - Machine Learning - Learning with Decision Trees

**Solve:**  Consider the following data set comprised of three binary input attributes (A1, A2, and A3) and one binary output. Use the algorithm in Figure 18.5 (page 702) to learn a decision tree for these data. Show the computations made to determine the attribute to split at each node.

    | Example | A1 | A2 | A3 | Output y |
    | ------: | -: | -: | -: | -------: |
    | x1      | 1  |  0 |  0 |        0 |
    | x2      | 1  |  0 |  1 |        0 |
    | x3      | 0  |  1 |  0 |        0 |
    | x4      | 1  |  1 |  1 |        1 |
    | x5      | 1  |  1 |  0 |        1 |

**Post:** Post your solution to the Assignments folder as a PDF file by Sunday at Midnight.
