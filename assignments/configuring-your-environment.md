# Configure Your Environment

1. **Configure:**  We will be using Python 3 for all of our assignments in this class.  Prepare your development environment by installing Python and and a code editor.

1. **Install Python 3:**  Install the latest version of _Anaconda Python 3_ for your operating system from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) > Products > Download.  If you are familiar with Python and are comfortable using pip and pipenv, then use your existing Python installation or create a new one by downloading Python from the [Official Python Site](https://www.python.org/) > Downloads.

1. **Install a coding editor:**  Anaconda Python now offers to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as part of it's install.  It is great choice but there are others such as [Atom](https://atom.io/).  Both are free and are well documented.
