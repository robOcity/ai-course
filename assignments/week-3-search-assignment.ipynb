This is commonly referred to as \"cloning\" a repository and you can find directions how to do it [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).  Git is what is called _version control_ software and is used to power the web-site GitHub.  You can interact with GitHub simply through your web browser, or by using client software.  I recommend sooner but the choice is up to you.  If you are using Linux or macOS, then you probably already have Git installed.  Enter `which git` at the command line, you will either see a path or `command not found`.  These lists of clients will provide you plenty of options to choose from:\n",

    "## Cloing a Repository\n",
    "To get a copy of all the code in the repository, you need to `clone` it.  This simply means \"copy it\" and allows you to interact with others in the development of open source software.  The aima-python repository can be found at [github.com/aimacode/aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python).  To clone simply enter `git clone https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python` from the command line.  Git will create a `aima-python` folder in whatever directory you ran the command from.  If you are using a GUI, find clone and provide it with `https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python`.   Once the command runs you should have the code downloaded.  Don't worry, you can delete this folder and repeat the process again and again.  "
