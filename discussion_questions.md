# Discussion Questions by week

## Weekly Discussion Questions

1.  Introducing Artificial Intelligence
    1.  Define intelligence, artificial intelligence, rationality and logical reasoning in your own words.
    2.  The neural structure of the sea slug Aplysia has been widely studied because it has only 20,000 neurons, most of which are large and easy to study.  Assuming the cycle time for the Aplysia neuron is roughly the same as a human neuron, how does the computation power compare to terms of memory updates per second, compare with the high-end computer described in Figure 1.3.
    3.  Do you think the following assertions are true or false.  Support you conclusions with a example or counter example where appropriate.  Please keep your answers to a sentence or two.
        1.  An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rations.
        2.  There exists task environments in which every agent is rational.
        3.  The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.
        4.   Every agent function is implementable by some combination of code and machine.
        5.  Suppose an agent selects it actions at random from a set of possible actions.  There exists a deterministic task environment in which this agent is rational.
        6. It is perfectly possible for an agent to be perfectly rational in two different task environments.
        7.  Every agent is rational in an unobservable environment.
        8.  A perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.

2.  Logical Agents Searching for Solutions
3.  Playing Adversarial Games
4.  Shrinking the Search Space
5.  Logical Agents in Wumpus World
6.  First-Order Logic
7.  Acting in an Uncertain World
8.  Applying Machine Learning

## Ethics
1.  An autonomous vehicle AI is presented with a difficult choice.  It either will hit a pedestrian or go off the road and hit a tree.
    1.  Who is would be responsible?
    2.  How could the AI "explain" its behavior?   Please research these questions and find examples to share with class and to build your case on.
