# Course Overview

Hello and welcome to MSDS 688 â€“ Artificial Intelligence.  By posing the question "Can machines think?" in 1950 Alan Turing initiates the field that we now know as artificial intelligence.  Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is assisting doctors in the early detection of cancers, virtual assistants use natural language to communicate, partially autonomous vehicles are on-sale at dealerships, and most importantly, recognizing cat videos on YouTube.  Taking inspiration from psychology, neuroscience, mathematics, physics and computer science; AI has made great progress and experienced significant setbacks.  In this course, we will learn how artificially intelligent systems work, grapple with their ethics implications, and implement expository examples in Python.
