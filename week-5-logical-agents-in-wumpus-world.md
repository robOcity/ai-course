# Week 5 - Logical Agents in Wumpus World

1. **Motivation:**  Humans use knowledge to help understand the world.  In AI, logic languages are used to represent knowledge to machines.  Currently, machines struggle with meaning or semtics of language.  Consider the sentence _"The trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase because it was too big. What was too big?"_.  Humans have no trouble with sentences like this but the very best model can only get %60 of multiple choice questions like this correct.  For machines to improve their performance they need to understand meaning and not simply learn from example.  While the Turing Test focuses on deception, the [Winograd Schema Challenge](http://commonsensereasoning.org/winograd.html) challenges reasoning.  This week we learn how to use propositional logic to represent knowledge for machines.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Construct sentences using propositional logic to represent knowledge.

    1. Produce new knowledge by applying inference rules to what is currently known.

    1. Illustrate the construction and use of knowledge base to achieve a goal.

    1. Explain the limits of propositional logic in describing relationships between objects and large environments.

1. **Readings**

    1. Listen to [Winograd Schema Challenge episode on the Data Skeptic podcast
    ](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2018/winograd-schema-challenge), or take a look at the [challenge itself](http://commonsensereasoning.org/winograd.html) and consider how machines have fared [in IEEE's results wrap-up](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/winograd-schema-challenge-results-ai-common-sense-still-a-problem-for-now).

    
    1. Read Chapter 7 - Logical Agents (all sections except 7.6)

    1. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

1. **Discussion**

    1. Discuss:  Programming assignment. Post questions about the assignment here and please offer assistance to others.

    1. Please read [Technical challenges in machine ethics](http://robohub.org/technical-challenges-in-machine-ethics/) and illustrate at least two different approaches to addressing ethical concerns in AI.  Can an AI be both logical and ethical?  What duties and obligations does an AI have?
