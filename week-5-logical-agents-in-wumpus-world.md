# Week 5 - Logical Agents in Wumpus World

1. **Motivation:**  In exploring a new world, up until now, our agents have relied _entirely_ upon information derived from their current state.  For example the cost and heuristic functions used in best-first-search.  Could we improve our agent's performance by storing knowledge?  If so, how would we represent what has been learned?  In this chapter we are introduced to Wumpus World - a simple grid-based hunting game -- and navigate through it using propositional logic and inference.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Construct sentences using propositional logic to represent knowledge.

    1. Produce new knowledge by applying inference rules to what is already known.

    1. Illustrate the construction and use of knowledge base to achieve a goal.

    1. Explain the limits of propositional logic in describing relationships between objects and large environments.

1. **Readings**

    1. Read Chapter 7 - Logical Agents (all sections except 7.6)

    1. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

1. **Discussion**

    1. Discuss:  Programming assignment. Post questions about the assignment here and please offer assistance to others.

    1. Read [Technical challenges in machine ethics](http://robohub.org/technical-challenges-in-machine-ethics/) and illustrate at least two different approaches to addressing ethical concerns in AI.  Can an AI be both logical and ethical?  What duties and obligations does an AI have?  _Support your position and post your discussion by midnight Wednesday.
