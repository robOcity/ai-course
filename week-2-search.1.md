# Week 2 - Searching for Solutions

1. Motivation: TODO

1. Learning objectives

    1. Contrast informed and uninformed search algorithms in terms of completness, optimality, time complexity and space complexity.

    1. Illustrate how a path through the state space from the initial state to the goal state is a product of actions taken to transistion from one state to the next.
    
    1. Explain and demonstrate breadth-first search, depth-first search, greedy best-first search and A* search algorithms.   

    1. Develop a working code that implement two different search algorithms.
