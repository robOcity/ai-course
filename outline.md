## Content by Week

Artificial intelligence is a broad and challenging subject and one that I hope students will enjoy.  Our text has has a wealth of material, much more than we can cover in 8 weeks.  My goals in selecting topics included:

*   Covering all essential topics
*   Avoid topics that are extensively covered in another course (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing, ...)
*   Determining the depth to go into logic and planning was challenging.  I decided to include only the amount of logic that students will need to be successful in the course.

My intuition is that the schedule contains to much content for the time available.  Some of the topics could easily go for a couple of weeks.  Also, I am thinking of adding extra credit homework problems to give students a chance to catch up, or to simply challenge themselves.

1.  **Introduction**
    1.  Motivation:  Introduces the subject and the concept of intelligent agents used throughout the text.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 1 - Introduction
        1.  Chapter 2 - Intelligent Agents

2.  **Search**
    1.  Motivation:  Introduces essential search algorithms such as breadth-first and depth-first search that do not minimize a cost function, and those that do, including A* search.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 3 - Problem Solving by Searching

3.  **Adversarial Games**
    1.  Motivation: Consolidate and deep learning of search techniques by applying algorithms to chess, backgammon and card games.  Hopefully students will find this fun and challenging.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 5 - Adversarial Searching

4.  **Shrinking the Search Space**
    1.  Motivation:  Using general purpose algorithms to apply constraints to efficiently and dramatically shrink the search space.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 6 - Constraint Satisfaction Problems

5.  **Prepositional Logic in Wumpus World**
    1.  Motivation: Introduces predicate logic and applies it to playing a simple grid-based hunting game called Wumpus World.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 7 - Logical Agents

6.  **First-Order Logic**
    1.  Motivation: First-order logic is more expressive and compact allowing for concise representations of complex environments
    1.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 8 - First-Order Logic

7.  **Acting in an Uncertain World**
    1.  Motivation: Rather than considering all possibilities, using probabilities eliminates the need to consider unlikely outcomes.
    2.  Reading
        1.  Chapter 13 - Uncertainty

8.  **Probabilistic Reasoning**
    1.  Motivation: Continue exploring probabilistic reasoning using Bayesian Networks to efficiently handle large intractable problems.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 14 - Probabilistic Reasoning

## Questions
1.  Is pair programming encouraged?
