## Content by Week

Artificial intelligence is a broad and challenging subject and one that I hope students will enjoy.  Our text has a wealth of material, much more than we can cover in 8 weeks.  My goals in selecting topics are:
*   Covering essential topics
*   Tie in machine learning to AI


1.  **Introducing Artificial Intelligence**
    1.  Motivation:  Introducing the field of artificial intelligence (AI), its history and foundations.  Our text focuses on rational agents that sense and act in their environment to achieve goals, and shows how artificially intelligent systems are constructed.
    1. Learning objectives
            1. Describe how thinking, acting and behaving provide a framework for understanding differing approaches to AI.
            2. Discuss the elements of a task environment and how they relate to the state space that the agent must navigate.
            4. Explain how a rational agent achieves a goal in an environment.
            5. Contrast simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents and utility-based agents.
    2.  Preparation
        1.  Read Chapter 1 - Introduction (Sections 1.1, 1.2 (skim), 1.3 (skim))
        2.  Read Chapter 2 - Intelligent Agents
    3.  From the experts
        1.  The British mathematician Alan Turing work was foundational in the field of artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science.  His original papers are available online and are quite readable.
            1.  Founding the field of artificial intelligence in 1950 with the publication of his "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" paper ([original](http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/9) and [pdf](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf)).  It is this paper that he proposes the a simple game where one contestant tries to determine something about another person.  Communication is limited to text.  Turing calls this the "imitation game" and asks what will happen when a machine is questioned.  Now known as the Turing test and conditions artificial intelligence on acting humanly.

            2.  Turing machines are a central topic in the study of theoretical computer science to this day.  Turing used this abstraction of what would become the modern computer to prove that an algorithm cannot determine if another algorithm will find a result and stop, or not.  Informally referred to as the halting problem, Turing showed that this decision problem is undecidable in his 1936 [paper](http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/12).

    4.  Assignment 1 - Select Python programming exercises from [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans)

2.  **Logical Agents Searching for Solutions**
    1.  Motivation:  Introducing search algorithms and how to improve their efficiency by minimizing a cost function.
    2.  Preparation
        1.  Read Chapter 3 - Problem Solving by Searching
    2.  Project: Surviving in Wumpus World

3.  **Playing Adversarial Games**
    1.  Motivation:  Applying search algorithms to well known games such as chess, backgammon and cards.
    2.  Preparation
        1.  Read Chapter 5 - Adversarial Search

4.  **Shrinking the Search Space**
    1.  Motivation:  Applying constraints allows the size of the search space to be dramatically reduced.
    2.  Preparation
        1.  Read Chapter 6 - Constraint Satisfaction Problems

5.  **Logical Agents in Wumpus World**
    1.  Motivation: Introducing predicate logic and applying it to Wumpus World - a simple grid-based hunting game.
    2.  Preparation
        1.  Read Chapter 7 - Logical Agents

6.  **First-Order Logic**
    1.  Motivation: Representing complex state concisely using first-order logic.
    1.  Preparation
        1.  Read Chapter 8 - First-Order Logic

7.  **Acting in an Uncertain World**
    1.  Motivation: Employing decision theory to eliminate unlikely outcomes from consideration.
    2.  Reading
        1.  Read Chapter 13 - Uncertainty
    3.  Project: Wumpus world revisited

8.  **Applying Machine Learning**
    1.  Motivation: Apply machine learning to improve the performance of artificially intelligent systems.
    2.  Preparation
        1.  Read Chapter 18 - Learning from Examples
