## Content by Week

Artificial intelligence is a broad and challenging subject and one that I hope students will enjoy.  Our text has has a wealth of material, much more than we can cover in 8 weeks.  My goals in selecting topics are:
*   Covering essential topics,
*   Avoiding topics that are covered in other courses such as machine learning and natural language processing.


1.  **Introduction**
    1.  Motivation:  Introducing the field of artificial intelligence, its history and foundations.  By sensing and taking actions to achieve goals, rational agents show how artificially intelligent systems are constructed.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 1 - Introduction
        1.  Chapter 2 - Intelligent Agents

2.  **Search**
    1.  Motivation:  Introducing search algorithms such as breadth-first, depth-first and A* search, and how the use of cost function improves their efficiency.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 3 - Problem Solving by Searching

3.  **Adversarial Games**
    1.  Motivation:  Applying search algorithms to well known games such as chess, backgammon and card.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 5 - Adversarial Search

4.  **Shrinking the Search Space**
    1.  Motivation:  Applying constraints to dramatically shrink the search space.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 6 - Constraint Satisfaction Problems

5.  **Prepositional Logic in Wumpus World**
    1.  Motivation: Introducing predicate logic and applying it to Wumpus World - a simple grid-based hunting game.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 7 - Logical Agents

6.  **First-Order Logic**
    1.  Motivation: Representing complex state concisely using first-order logic.
    1.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 8 - First-Order Logic

7.  **Acting in an Uncertain World**
    1.  Motivation: Applying decision theory to eliminate unlikely outcomes from consideration.
    2.  Reading
        1.  Chapter 13 - Uncertainty

8.  **Probabilistic Reasoning**
    1.  Motivation: Representing probabilistic relations using Bayesian Networks to capture uncertain knowledge and how practically apply probabilistic inference.
    2.  Readings
        1.  Chapter 14 - Probabilistic Reasoning
