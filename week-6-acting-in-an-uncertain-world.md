# Week 6 - Acting in an Uncertain World

1. Motivation: Your favorite band is in town and you have two tickets for tonight's sold out show.  You and your friend are planning want to get something to eat before the show.  Seating is general admission, so you need to arrive with plenty to get a decent seat.  If the concert starts at 8 PM, when do you leave home?  When do you need to arrive at the restarant and the concert venue?  By the end of this lecture you will be able to create a causality diagram, develop the truth tables to support it, and understand it's basis in probability theory. 

1. Learning objectives

    1. Describe why logic alone is impractical for modeling real-world problems.

    1. Apply probability theory to develop and simplifiy casuality diagrams.

    1. Combine truth tables and casuality diagrams to create probalistic belief nets.

    1. Illustrate how belief nets allow intelligent agents to make better decisions when facing uncertainty.

    1. Estimate probabilities for moves in wumpus world.

1. Readings
    1. Read Chapter 13 - Uncertainty (all sections) 

    1. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

1. Discussion

    1. Model an uncertian situation you have faced in your life using belief nets.  Make sure to describe the context you faced the goals and preferences that you had.  Create the truth tables and casual diagram for this situation.  Post your diagram as an inline figure in your discussion post.  Please submit your post by Wednesday evening at midnight and comment on two other students work by Sunday evening at midnight.
