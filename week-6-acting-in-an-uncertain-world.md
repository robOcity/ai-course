# Week 6 - Probabilistic Reasoning

1. **Motivation:** Your favorite band is in town and you have two tickets for tonight's sold out show.  You and your friend are planning to go and want to get something to eat before the show.  Seating is general admission, so you need to arrive with plenty to get a decent seat.  If the concert starts at 8 PM, when do you leave home?  When do you need to arrive at the restaurant and the concert venue?  By the end of this lecture you will be able to create a causality diagram, develop the truth tables to support it, and understand it's basis in probability theory.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Illustrate how belief nets allow intelligent agents to make better decisions when facing uncertainty.

    1. Estimate probabilities for moves for example problems.  

1. **Readings**

    1. Read Chapter 14 - Probabilistic Reasoning (Sections 14.1 through 14.5)

    1. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

1. **Discussion**

    1. Discuss:  Programming assignment. Post any questions you have about the assignment here and please offer assistance to others.

    1. Discuss: Consider the topics we have covered in the course:

      * Finding solution using search
      * Applying search to adversarial environments
      * Solving constraint satisfaction problems
      * Probabilistic reasoning in uncertain situations
      * Learning from examples

      Pick one topic, find out who it is being used today, what problems is being applied and by what industries.  Find job openings that are looking for people skilled in this domain.  Where are the jobs, what skill sets are in demand and additional training do you need.  Please write three paragraphs and cite your sources.  _Please submit your post by Wednesday evening at midnight and read all other students posts by Sunday evening at midnight._
