# Week 6 - Probabilistic Reasoning

1. **Motivation:**  

    > Linda is 31 years old, single,outspoken and very bright. he majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination  and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.
    >
    >Which is more probable?
        >
        >1. Linda is a bank teller.
        >
        >2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

    The majority of those asked chose option 2. However, the probability of two events occurring together (in "conjunction") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring aloneâ€”formally, for two events A and B this inequality could be written as `P(A ^ B) <= P(A)` and  `P(A ^ B) <= Pr(B)`. Amos Tversky's secretary at Stanford was named Linda Covington, and he named the famous character in the puzzle after her.

2. **Learning objectives**

    1. Illustrate how belief nets allow intelligent agents to make better decisions when facing uncertainty.

    2. Estimate probabilities for moves for example problems.

3. **Readings**

    1. Read Chapter 14 - Probabilistic Reasoning (Sections 14.1 through 14.5)

    2. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

5. **Discussion**

    1. Discuss:  Programming assignment. Post any questions you have about the assignment here and please offer assistance to others.

    2. Discuss: Consider the topics we have covered in the course:

      * Finding solution using search
      * Applying search to adversarial environments
      * Solving constraint satisfaction problems
      * Probabilistic reasoning in uncertain situations
      * Learning from examples

      Pick one topic, find out who it is being used today, what problems is being applied and by what industries.  Find job openings that are looking for people skilled in this domain.  Where are the jobs, what skill sets are in demand and additional training do you need.  Please write three paragraphs and cite your sources.  _Please submit your post by Wednesday evening at midnight and read all other students posts by Sunday evening at midnight._
