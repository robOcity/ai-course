    # Why python?

    * General purpose programming language
        - Strenghts in data science and web development

    * Efficient syntax designed to be read by people

    * Gradual learning curve supports beginners and advanced users

    * An interpreted language
        - Code is compiled at runtime --> Hence reputation for being slow
        - Bindings to C for libraries like Numpy --> Result in high performance
        - What is more valuable? Developer time or machine time?
        - If the later, analyze and optimize bottlenecks

    * Friendly and inclusive community of developers

    # The short history of Python

    * Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s

    * Named for _Monty Python Flying Circus_ British TV show from the 1970's

    * Versions
        - 1994 version 1
        - 2000 version 2
        - 2008 version 3
        - 2016 version 3.6
        - 2018 version 3.7 (expected)

    * Python 2.7 end-of-life is Jan 1, 2020
            > Let's not play games with semantics. The way I see the situation for 2.7
            > is that EOL is January 1st, 2020, and there will be no updates, not even
            > source-only security patches, after that date. Support (from the core devs,
            > the PSF, and python.org) stops completely on that date.
            > _Guido van Rossum_, Python BDFL

    * **We will use Python 3 in this course**

    # Environment

    * Anaconda Python is recommended
        - Why Anaconda?  Most data science package are included.  You are ready to go with minimal setup.
        - Download the **Python 3.latest version** for your OS from [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
        - Alternatively, if you are comfortable with Python, you can install all the same tools using pip.
