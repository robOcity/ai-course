# Week 7 - Machine Learning in AI

1. Motivation: Applying machine learning to improve the performance of artificially intelligent systems.

1. Learning objectives

    1. Explain how computation learning theory eliminates poorly performing models leaving those that are probably approximately correct.

    1. Construct a decision tree by recursively selecting the most important feature.

    1. Compare common approaches to improving the performance of decision trees.

    1. Evaluate model performance and how it can be improved through cross-validation and regularization.

    1. Understand the tradeoff between bias, variance and model complexity.

1. Readings
    1. Read Chapter 18 - Learning from Examples (sections 18.1 through 18.4)

1. Discussion

    1. Consider the problem faced by an infant learning to speak and understand a language.  Explain how this process fits into the general learning model. Describe the percepts and actions of the infant, and the types of learning the infant must do. Describe the subfunctions the infant is trying to learn in terms of inputs and outputs, and available example data.  _Please submit your post by Wednesday evening at midnight and comment on two other students work by Sunday evening at midnight._

    1. Suppose we generate a training set from a decision tree and then apply decision-tree learning to that training set. Is it the case that the learning algorithm will eventually return the correct tree as the training-set size goes to infinity? Why or why not? _Please submit your post by Wednesday evening at midnight and comment on two other students work by Sunday evening at midnight._
