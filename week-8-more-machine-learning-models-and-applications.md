    1. Read: [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](./resources/hinton_cnn_imagenet.pdf) - This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of deep CNN architecture for image recognition problems and catalyzed interest in deep neural networks.  The number of Google searches for deep neural networks through time.  ![Number of Google searches for deep neural networks through time](./images/deep_learning_and_nn_searches.png)

    1. Read: [Learning Internal Representations by Error Propagation](./resources/hinton_nn_back_prop_pdp8.pdf) - Neural network research had been stagnating for roughly 17 years.  This paper changed all that by showing the value of adding additional layers to a neural network.  It contains two very important results.  First, in the late 1960's it was thought that the inability of single layer neural networks to solve the [XOR problem](http://www.ece.utep.edu/research/webfuzzy/docs/kk-thesis/kk-thesis-html/node19.html) and represented a fundamental weakness.  The [solution](http://www.ece.utep.edu/research/webfuzzy/docs/kk-thesis/kk-thesis-html/node20.html) is to simply add a hidden layer to the neural network and use _feed-forward propagation_.  Second, using _back propagation_ to adjust weights and trains a neural network to fit the labeled data.  Through an iterative process the weights are adjusted until the error is minimized.  

1. Discussion

    1. Read Section 26.3 - The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence.  Analyze the potential threats from AI technology to society.  What threats are the most serious, and how might they be combated?  How do they compare to the potential benefits?

    1. Watch [Google I/O 2018 Google's Duplex Demo Stole the Show](https://youtu.be/NO0-5MuJvew) on YouTube.

    1. Discuss: What ethical concerns do you have about Google Duplex?  Please respond in a short essay (of no more than 300 words) supporting your position and cite supporting materials.
