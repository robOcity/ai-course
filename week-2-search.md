# Week 2 - Searching for Solutions

1. **Motivation:** Searching for solutions using algorithms with differing strategies, understanding their cost, and learning how to measure their performance.  Imagine playing checkers without knowing any of the rules -- this is uninformed search -- and yes, winning would take a long time.  Informed search -- where we know the rule and can evaluate the cost of each -- is a much more efficient way of finding the goal.  This week we will examine both types of algorithms, understand their costs, and learn how to measure their performance.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Construct a model of a search tree, explain the role of nodes and edges, and explain the difference between a graph and tree.

    1. Contrast informed and uninformed search algorithms in terms of completeness, optimality, time complexity and space complexity.

    1. Illustrate how a path through the state space from the initial state to the goal state is a product of actions taken to transition from one state to the next.

    1. Explain and demonstrate breadth-first search, depth-first search, greedy best-first search and A* search algorithms.

1. **Readings**

    1. Read Chapter 3 - Solving Problems by Searching (all - except for 3.5.3, 3.6.2-4)

    1. Text: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd ed). Prentice-Hall. 2010.

1. **Discussion**

    1. **Discuss** - Programming assignment. Post questions about the assignment here and offer assistance to others.  _Include the name of the koan and test that you are looking for help on  in your title._

    1. **Discuss** - What is the difference between a world state, a state description, and a search node?  Why is the distinction useful?  _Post your response by Wednesday and find two others who approached the problem differently, acknowledge the differences and seek common ground._

1. **Programming Assignment**

    1. **Configure:**  Use the Python 3 development environment you built last week to complete this assignment. 

    1. **Complete:** From the Python Koans repository, complete the following Koans in the **python3 folder**.  If you need help or have questions, please post to week's programming assignment discussion topic.

        1. about_true_and_false.py

        1. about_dictionaries.py

        1. about_classes.py

        1. about_methods.py

        1. about_inheritance.py

    1. **Submit:**

        1. Run all koans using the `run.sh` script for macOS or Linux systems, or `run.bat` script for Windows systems.

        1. Take a screen shot of your results and submit it to dropbox by midnight Sunday.
