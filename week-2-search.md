# Week 2 - Searching for Solutions

1. **Motivation:** Introducing search algorithms and how to improve their efficiency by minimizing a cost function.  Solving a problem involves moving from an initial state to the goal.  The domain of a problem, say the board game checkers, controls the number of possible states and the actions that can be taken.  Imagine playing checkers without knowing any of the rules -- this is uninformed search -- and yes, winning would take a long time.  Informed search -- where we know the rule and can evaluate the cost of each -- is a much more efficient way of finding the goal.  This week we will examine both types of algorithms, understand their costs, and learn how to measure their performance.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Construct a model of a search tree, explain the role of nodes and edges, and explain the difference between a graph and a tree.

    1. Contrast informed and uninformed search algorithms in terms of completeness, optimality, time complexity and space complexity.

    1. Illustrate how a path through the state space from the initial state to the goal state is a product of actions taken to transition from one state to the next.

    1. Explain and demonstrate breadth-first search, depth-first search, greedy best-first search and A* search algorithms.

1. **Discussion**

    1. **Discuss** - Programming assignment. Post questions about the assignment here and offer assistance to others.  _Include the name of the koan and test that you are looking for help on  in your title._

    1. **Discuss** - What is the difference between a world state, a state description, and a search node?  Why is the distinction useful?  _Post your response by Wednesday and find two others who approached the problem differently, acknowledge the differences and seek common ground._
