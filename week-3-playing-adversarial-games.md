# Week 3 - Playing Adversarial Games

1. **Motivation:** Learning to apply search algorithms to popular games such as chess, backgammon and cards.  We will use the minmax algorithm to illustrate how large a search tree can grow and discover that pruning allows for more complex games to be played.  Understanding the limits of optimal game play sets the stage for a deeper examination of search through our implementation of our own 8-puzzle solvers.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Explain the minmax algorithm and be able to apply it to simple games.

    1. Diagram the search tree it generated by minmax search and calculate its size.

    1. Quantify the effect that alpha-beta pruning has on search tree.

    1. Summarize how and why optimal game play differs from what is practical.

    1. Develop working code that implements two different search algorithms.

    1. Given what you have learned this week, how well do you think that the standard approach to game playing would work for games like tennis, pool, and croquet, which take place in a continuous physical state space?  _Support your answer in your discussion by midnight Wednesday.
