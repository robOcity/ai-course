# Week 3 - Playing Adversarial Games

1. **Motivation:**  How can we apply the concepts of search to playing games against an opponent?  Building a search tree to represent the state of play, we will learn how to apply the minimax search algorithm to find optimal moves.  By pruning the search tree, alpha-beta search is both optimal and efficient.  Estimating the probability of different actions allows these algorithms to be extended to games of chance.

1. **Learning objectives**

    1. Explain the minimax algorithm and be able to apply it to simple games.

    1. Diagram the search tree generated by the minimax search algorithm and calculate its size.

    1. Quantify the efficiency gains of using alpha-beta pruning.

    1. Summarize how and why optimal game play differs from what is practical.

    1. Develop working code that analyzes the performance a search algorithms.

1. **Discussion**

    1. Discuss:  Programming assignment. Post questions about the assignment here and please offer assistance to others.

    1. Discuss:  Given what you have learned this week, how well do you think that the standard approach described in Chapter 5 -- Adversarial Search to game playing would work for games like tennis, pool, and croquet, which take place in a continuous physical state space?  _Support your position and post your discussion by midnight Wednesday.
