Course: Artificial Intelligence
Due:  5/1/2018


I created a thorough breakdown of deliverables, which I put at the end of this email.  This looks a bit daunting because it is long, but it is basically what we had talked about, with the addition/updates of the worldclass components.  Each week has an overview, to-do list, and “from the expert”, which in our case can be the textbook chapters and any extra resources that you want to share (links or your own creations, like the slide deck).

WorldClass shell

    Syllabus
        6-8 learning objectives
        What the students should be able to do after completion of the course
        use Bloom’s taxonomy
    Course overview
        A short paragraph overviewing the course
    Overview and Outcomes
        Short (paragraph) overview of the week’s material
        Learner Outcomes -- typically 3-6 outcomes.  These are what students should be able to do or what they should learn during the week.
    To-do list
        A list of items to finish for the week
        Description of the assignments
        Description of discussion questions
    From the Expert
        If there is a textbook, this can be relatively short.  Example: MT475 has the book chapters listed, and links to optional videos for each week.
        If there is not a textbook, a PDF document summarizing the topic should be created.  Typically this is around 5-10 pages.
    Reading list
        A PDF/word/google doc of the readings for each week
    Discussion questions
        A document with discussion questions for each week.  Typically 2-4 questions are used for discussions each week.
        Discussion questions should be in a single PDF/word/Google docs document, so that instructors can post the discussion thread when they teach the course.
    Assignments
        A document with the assignments and assignment descriptions for each week.
        Solutions for each assignment.
    Notes for instructors
        A document with any special notes necessary for instructors.
    Gradebook
        This should match the syllabus


Finally, a slide deck (.ppt or open office) for in-person courses and for from the export (FTE) material
