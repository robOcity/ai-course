# Week 1 - Introducing Artificial Intelligence

1 Motivation:  Introducing the field of artificial intelligence (AI), its history and foundations.  Our text focuses on rational agents that sense and act in their environment to achieve goals, and shows how artificially intelligent systems are constructed.

1. Learning objectives

    1. Describe how thinking, acting and behaving provide a framework for understanding differing approaches to AI.

    1. Discuss the elements of a task environment and how they relate to the state space that the agent must navigate.

    1. Explain how a rational agent achieves a goal in an environment.

    1. Contrast simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents and utility-based agents.

1. From the experts

    1.  The British mathematician Alan Turing work was foundational in the field of artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science.  His original work is available online and is surprisinglyt readable.

        1.  By posing the deceptively simple question "Can machines think?", Alan Turing initiated what would become field of artificial intelligence with the publication of his "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" paper ([original](http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/9) and [pdf](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf)) in 1950.  In this paper he proposes a simple game where the contestant tries to determine which one of two hidden conttestents is a computer.  All communication is limited to text.  Calling this the "imitation game", asks what would happen when a machine is questioned, and whether it should be considered intelligent if it able to fool the human.  The Turing test conditions artificial intelligence on acting humanly.

        2.  Turing machines -- a hypothetical machine that is capable of simulating *any* computer algorithm -- are a central topic in theoretical computer science.  Turing used this abstraction to prove that an algorithm cannot determine if another algorithm will find a result and stop, or not. Known as the halting problem, Turing showed that this problem is undecidable in his 1936 [paper](http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/12). Cite: Copeland, J. (2000, July).

1. Discussion
1.  Do you think the following assertions are true or false.  Support you conclusions with a example or counter example where appropriate.  Please pick four of the following, and keep your answers to a sentence or two.
1.  An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rations.
1.  There exists task environments in which every agent is rational.
1.  The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.
1.   Every agent function is implementable by some combination of code and machine.
1.  Suppose an agent selects it actions at random from a set of possible actions.  There exists a deterministic task environment in which this agent is rational.
1. It is perfectly possible for an agent to be perfectly rational in two different task environments.
1.  Every agent is rational in an unobservable environment.
1.  A perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.
