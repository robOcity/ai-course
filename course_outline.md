# Course Outline

1. [Week 1 - Introducing Artificial Intelligence](./week-1-introducing-ai.md) - By sensing and acting to obtain a goal -- rational agents -- offer a firm foundation for understanding artificially intelligent systems.  Prepare for this journey by examining the field's history and core ideas.

1. [Week 2 - Searching for Solutions](./week-2-search.md) - Searching for solutions using algorithms with differing strategies, understanding their cost, and learning how to measure their performance.

1. [Week 3 - Playing Adversarial Games](./week-3-playing-adversarial-games.md) - Learning to apply search algorithms to popular games and discovering that pruning allows for more complex games to be played.

1. [Week 4 - Constraining the Search Space](./week-4-constraining-the-search-space.md) - Applying constraints to reduce the size of the search space resulting in dramatic improvements in search algorithm performance.

1. [Week 5 - Logical Agents in Wumpus World](./week-5-logical-agents-in-wumpus-world.md) - Introducing first-order logic and applying it to Wumpus World - a simple grid-based hunting game.

1. [Week 6 - Acting in an Uncertain World](./week-6-acting-in-an-uncertain-world.md) - Employing decision theory to eliminate unlikely outcomes from consideration.

1. [Week 7 - Applying Machine Learning I](./week-7-applying-machine-learning-1.md) - Appling machine learning to improve the performance of artificially intelligent systems.

1. [Week 8 - Applying Machine Learning II](./week-8-applying-machine-learning-2.md) - Continuing examination of machine learning in artificially intelligent systems.
